RSBot Script Stats
==================

Official website can be found here: http://goddfree.com/rsbot-script-stats/

This is a quick PHP script that I wrote to make storing script usage data in online databases easy. Aside from username and run time, which are automatically stored, script writers can set up to four other parameters to record. The code also includes a “hiscores” system which displays the stats of all users.

More information about this script and its usage can be found on my website, link provided above.
